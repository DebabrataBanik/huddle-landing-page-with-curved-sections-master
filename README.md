### Continued Development

During this project, I faced a few challenges and identified areas for improvement:

- Responsiveness: Maintaining responsiveness across the entire viewport range was challenging. Ensuring that the layout adapted well to different screen sizes required significant effort and adjustments.

- Background Design: Adjusting the background design to match the provided design specifications was a real struggle. It was difficult to align and position background elements correctly across various screen sizes.

- Newsletter Interactivity: Instead of implementing JavaScript logic for the newsletter, I used an active state to simulate interactivity. This might not be the best approach, and I plan to learn and implement proper JavaScript handling for interactive elements in future projects.
